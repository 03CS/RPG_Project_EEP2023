# RPG_Project_EEP2023
This was a project that I worked on for my EEP term in Fall 2023, where I incorporated different aspects of an RPG game. 
With the help of practice modules and YouTube tutorials I was able to follow along in making this RPG game that I added some new elements to, such as a character selection screen and additional assets from itch.io.

The map and enemies in game are placeholders, there are many enemies and objects in the game that are unused because of the preformance impact.

To start the game run the main.py file.
